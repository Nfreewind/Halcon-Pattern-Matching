# Halcon Pattern Matching

Allows a user to acquire images from a camera and use the mouse to define a region on a selected image. 
A shape model is crafted from the selected region and serialized with the original image. 
Live acquisition from the camera is then overlayed with the best match from the previously selected shape model.

Halcon License is required to run this sample program.
